# Reddit-Pokemon-Stats
A bot which searches comments asking for Pokemon stats and then replies with the formatted stats

Issues:
There are a couple problems that are known, some commented in the code itself but those things will stay for now.
Also, some parts of the code could probably be improved and be prettier but again, that's not something I'm planning on going back to clean up anytime soon.


Instructions: Make sure you have the excel sheet provided as well as the code, the excel sheet contains the pokemon names along with the stats. If you have everything, the bot should work fine once started. Remember to write in your own reddit account/bot account's username and password in the code, along with the subreddit you want it to work in.
