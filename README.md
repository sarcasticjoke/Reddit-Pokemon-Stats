A bot which searches comments asking for Pokemon stats and then replies with the formatted stats

There are a couple problems that are known, some commented in the code itself but those things will stay for now.
Also, some parts of the code could probably be improved and be prettier but again, that's not something I'm planning on going back to clean up anytime soon.

The biggest change that needs to be made at the moment is the inclusion of the new Sun and Moon Pokemon, it shouldn't take long so that will come soon.
